.SH NAME
wl-clipboard-x11 - A wrapper to use wl-clipboard as a drop-in replacement to X11 clipboard tools

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wl-clipboard-x11
[ 
.I ARGS
]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wl-clipboard-x11 
is a very simple script that allows using 
.B wl-clipboard
in lieu of X11 clipboard tools (\fBxclip\fP and \fBxsel\fP).

It tries to translate positional arguments to equivalent ones in \fBwl-clipboard\fP,
using \fBargv[0]\fP (calling command) to determine if it's emulating \fBxclip\fP or \fBxsel\fP.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
The following positional arguments have no equivalent feature in \fBwl-clipboard\fP, and thus
are ignored by \fBwl-clipboard-x11\fP.
